# Create An API with PHP. 


<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p> 

In first the code i created use PHP langage. 
The goal of this project was to creade an API and join it with a database.</br> 
And then you can create , delete, add or update your table as you wish.</br>
So let see how he works.

</p>

### Code Requirements
<h3> Installation.</h3>
1) In first you have to import the database file into Wamp(in localhost) as "wamp/www/yourprojectfile"</br>
2) In a second part you have to open every single file of the project in an IDE.</br>
3) And in the third part you have to open postman and use every file.php.</br>
as "method" and "htttp://localhost/api/post/file.php".

<h2>Program Requirements.</h2>
1) Download Postman first for test the API</br> 
2) Download Wamp, because we need to create our database or import it.</br>
3) Download an IDE for run the code or set it as you wish.</br>
4) As Web Browser you can use which one you want, it will work.

<h1>Better To Use Postman abnd WHY</h2>
<ul>  
  <li>Postman is really easy to use.</li>
  <li>Indeed you can actually launch it in a web browser but you can not choose which method you want.</li>
  <li>Every class work with a different method or that will not work on.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Execution Part.</h2>
To run the code, just type as "method" and "htttp://localhost/api/post/file.php", in Postman.</br>
Don't forget to open the file.php in an IDE, in the aim to know which methods you have to choose.</br>
Some file.php have a different methods to work with.
